The OCD fear/trigger can be literally *any* thought
-----------------------------
"I ***100% agree*** that this single mistake has instantly turned me into a wholly 'very bad person' whose every imaginable aspect (their blood cells, bone densities, total number of hair follicles, beliefs, actions), is 'very bad' from all conceivable - even orthogonal - standpoints.

"I'm having strong feelings of depression but I have to work.

So the problem is that by the time I'm done with these changes, the adderall will have worn off and I will be too anhedonic to do something I enjoy. 
So, I could _try_ and enjoy myself now and do the work when the anhedonia is fading.

So (again), what do I want to do? Hearthstone.
Sub 2 mins:
SITUATION:      looking at deck. decide it's shit.

THOUGHT:       there's very little chance of winning with that, which means...

BELIEF:        [FOCD] i'll probably lose and might feel very hurt, might be unable to bear the hurt, and might kill myself.

CONSEQUENCES:   cold running through veins, warmth turns to darkness, pit of fear in gut, self-blame, enjoyment vanishes

CHALLENGES:     
Hmm. So. Right. Well that is an FOCD Spike. It's semantically identical to EPG (Eye-Popping Girl) fearing subways or PM (Paedo Man) fearing school yards. It's a situation in which my poor, broken Mind feels is threatening and it hence throws-up the defences.
It's not threatening, just like the subway and school yards aren't. Hence the feeling of fear is unfounded and baseless, nay 'incorrect'. 
But that doesn't mean it feels any good. It sucks. 
And then there's the 'follow-on' damage that can originate from '-fun + +sadness == 'depression-causing', which leads to brutal self-blame for 'jeopardising' my life. Again.

So, what to do? Not sure, really. Sometimes the moment is gone with that Spike, which is why we bring them in - to declaw them, to desensitise our poor, battered Minds (and bodies) to them. Maybe just be mindful for a bit.
